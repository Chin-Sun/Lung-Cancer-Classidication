# Project Introduction: 
A service is accessible on the Internet. Its design follows RESTful architecture style that runs on AWS Cloud platform and meets the requirements below. The service interface is defined on Dast API by using SwaggerHub open APIs.

Cloud and open community provide pre-trained models that can be leveraged to deliver smart services. My service can integrate with my hugging face model to deliver the cloud enable development,configuration and integration of multiple types of services.

# Project Tasks:

1. Utilize a Cloud platform such as Amazon EC2. And take advantage of S3 or DynamoDB.
2. Design the data model of your services.  
3. Use a NoSQL data store for managing the data of your application.  
4. Select a Hugging face model or a Cloud AI service to integrate  
5. Develop and deploy the service with integration to 4
6. Expose REST/Open APIs to SwaggerHub
7. Do performance and operation measurement

## Main function of my project: 
My service can help users to detect whether they have lung cancer or not with the help of AI-driven image analysis. What they need to do is to upload their lung image on our application. And then they can get a result which will show their diagnosis results
